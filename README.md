# Rental Bike Demand Prediction
- Submitted by: Stuti Gupta
- Objective
With the available independent variables, we must model the demand for shared bikes. The management will use it to determine precisely how the needs change with changing features. They can adjust their business approach in accordance with demand levels and client expectations. The model will also help management better grasp the dynamics of demand in a new market.

- For this, a multiple linear regression model was build which gave R squared value near about 83%.
